# Javascript Reading

### Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

One thing that I knew already was that computers use binary (0s and 1s) as their foundations for all data that they recieve. 

One thing that I learned from this reading was actually the trick they used to check if a value is “real” (not null or undefined) by comparing it to null with == or !=. Since null == undefined evaluates to true, this conveniently covers both cases at once, while all other values will return false.

### Chapter 2: Program Structure

One thing that I knew already was that "if" statements allow code to run only when a condition is true.

One thing that I learned from this reading was the use of a "switch" when dispatching on a value. I like how it can be used to give a cleaner look than just a long chain of "if/else" statements, and just letting results be decided based off of the different cases. 

### Chapter 3: Functions

One thing that I knew already was that functions can be named so you can call them later in your code.

One thing that I learned was about the "nested scope", and how it allows functions intside other functions to access variables on the outer scope, but not the other way around. I didn't quite get it right away which grabbed my attention, but there example for the hummus ingredients actually helped so much lol. And the way that the code ended up looking pretty similar to how we worked with SQL in the terminal was also interesting.
