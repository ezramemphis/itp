# Python Reading

## Chapter 1: The Way of the Program

What I knew: I already knew the difference between an integer and a floating-point number.

What I learned: I didn't know much at all about the differences between "natural languages" and "formal languages". One part that really stook out to me about it all is that we really take so many liberities when we just speak in general, yet we always seem to get the idea across. But with formal as you can see, you can't leave a smidgen for interpretation when writing out the language, or else it just won't work. 

## Chapter 3: Functions

What I knew: I already knew that there is a specific order in which statements run in, which is the flow of execution. Meaning that basically all of the statements run one at a time, in order from top to bottom. 

What I learned: I didn't know that you actually had to import a math module to be able and do more advanced math problems. I guess I always assumed that code and computers were just built to be great at math, and so having to manually feed it that knowledge was something I didn't know or expect. And this did make me curious about what math knowledge javascript had built-in. And it made me realize, that's why we have the built in MATH object, and we just call it when we need it, but it's always available. This was like a 2-for-1 deal of learning, fantastic. 

## Chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursion

What I knew: I knew that a "boolean expression" is an epression that is either true or false (or checking for truthiness). And I also knew about the "==" operator, so booyah.

What I learned: I didn't know about Recursion before this reading, but I actually found it really cool and pretty sleek. Of course in short, it's a function that calls itself, but jsut the opportunities that this gives is so cool. Just like the cool generative art ideas that it kind of opens up is really cool.

## Chapter 10: Lists

What I knew: I already knew that a list is a "sequence of values". 

What I learned: I will say I thought I knew a decent bit about lists until I got about halfway through this chapter, and holy crap. I mean just the section for "Map, filter and reduce" was a whole lot to take in lol. I'm not sure if I 100% got it but I'll try my best to demonstrate I wrapped my noggin around it. So the "map" is when you take a function and apply it to every item in a list. I think the "filter" is just when you only want to pick some items and not the others based on some sort of specification you want to filter them with. And then "reduce" is when you combine all the items into a single value, kind of adding them up. I feel like I'm still waiting for some of it to click, but it's pretty interesting.
